# Reliks DAO

## Mission statement
Our mission is to "mainstreamify" NFTs into the Gaming community.
We understand that building games is very complicated by itself, let
alone incorporating NFTs (and it's intricacies) to the tech-stack ðŸ¤¯.

We aim to serve as an on-ramp gateway into blockchain technology (that is all).

## Core Tenets
- For one to go fast, he must go well.
- No premature abstractions.
- Balance between pragmatism and perfectionism. (Babble your thought process. It must make sense to you and to others.)
- There is always a cost of opportunity in everything. Do not fool yourself.
- Live to serve, serve to live.

*Technology is a powerful force in our society. Data, software, and communications can
be used for bad: to entrench unfair power structures, to undermine human rights, and to protect vested interests. But they can also be used for good: to make underrepresented peopleâ€™s voices heard, to create opportunities for everyone, and to avert disasters. This project is for everyone working towards the good.*
