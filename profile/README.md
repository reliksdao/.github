# Reliks DAO

## Mission statement
Our purpose is to "mainstreamify" blockchain technology into gaming.
We understand that building games is a feat by itself, let alone
incorporating NFTs (and it's intricacies) to the tech-stack ðŸ¤¯.

## Core Tenets
- For one to go fast, he must go well.
- No premature abstractions.
- Balance between pragmatism and perfectionism. (Babble your thought process. It must make sense to you and to others.)
- There is always a cost of opportunity in everything. Do not fool yourself.
- Live to serve, serve to live.

*Technology is a powerful force in our society. Data, software, and communication can
be used for bad: to entrench unfair power structures, to undermine human rights, and to protect vested interests. But they can also be used for good: to make underrepresented peopleâ€™s voices heard, to create opportunities for everyone, and to avert disasters. This book is dedicated to everyone working toward the good.*
